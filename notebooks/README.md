# Notebooks

`smog_usage_example.ipynb` shows a full package workflow using
`tests/resources/sectional_masses.csv`:

- generate sectional point-mass clouds
- combine them into one cloud
- export OpenFOAM point masses (`.txt`)
- export ParaView-readable point cloud (`.ply`)
- visualize with a 3D matplotlib plot
